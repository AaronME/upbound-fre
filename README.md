# RDS as a Service

This Configuration bundles an Upbound Cloud extension and an API definition. The
API will allow control planes to provision fully configured Amazon Relational
Database Service (RDS) instances, composed using cloud service primitives from
the [Upbound Official AWS
Provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws). The
extension enables a hosted portal in Upbound Cloud for interacting with your
control planeâ€™s APIs.
